# NBA Android Studio App
This is an NBA Android Studio app with CRUD features, JSON persistence, splash screen, and search filtering.

## Installation
To run the app, you will need to have Android Studio installed on your machine. Once you have Android Studio installed, follow these steps:

Clone this repository onto your local machine.
Open Android Studio and select Open an existing Android Studio project.
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the NBA-Android-App folder.
Wait for Android Studio to sync the project.
Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
## Usage
The app allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of NBA teams. You can also search for specific teams using the search bar.

When you first launch the app, you will be greeted with a splash screen. After the splash screen, you will see the list of NBA teams. To add a new team, click on the Add button in the bottom right corner of the screen. To edit or delete a team, simply click on the team in the list.

## Persistence
The app uses JSON persistence to store the list of NBA teams. When you add, edit, or delete a team, the changes are saved to a JSON file on the device.
